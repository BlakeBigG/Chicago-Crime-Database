# Chicago-Crime-Database
This is from a database course that I took, so the notebooks contain directions that I followed. The main output of part 1 is the chicago_crime_erd.png file,
which is an image of an ERD I drew. In addition to the ERD, there is a file called ChicagoData-Description.pdf that contains descriptions of each column.

Part 2 is where I wrote SQL commands to create the database and load the data in.

In part 3, I was assigned a list of queries to write. This serves as evidence of my knowledge of writing SQL queries.
